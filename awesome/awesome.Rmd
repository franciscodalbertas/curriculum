# About me

I am a landscape ecologist with master’s and doctoral training in ecology. My work focuses on nature-based solutions that promote biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. I assess the ecological and economic impacts of conservation strategies, such as ecological restoration, with a particular emphasis on carbon credit projects as a tool to deliver credible and effective outcomes. Throughout my career, I have oriented my work toward applied questions, with the goal of informing policy and guiding real-world conservation decisions. Currently, I work at the University of Cambridge, leading research on the carbon and biodiversity outcomes of tropical restoration under production displacement (leakage).
